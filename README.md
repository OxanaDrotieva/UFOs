# UFOs

## Overview of Project

This project is created to put UFO data - an article and a table of sightings with filters on date, city, state, country and shape from a JavaScript file in an HTML page.

## Results

This is the original unfiltered data:

- If someone wants to filter the table to get only sightings that happened on 1/4/2010 they can do it by entering "1/4/2010" in an "Enter Date" box and get only needed results.

- If someone wants to filter the table to get only sightings that happened in a particular city, for instance,  El Cajon, they can get this data by  entering "el cajon" in an "Enter City" box.

- And finally, if you need to know only about sightings with circle shape you can do it by filtering the table in the  "Enter Shape" box.

## Summary 

Therefore users can see the article, the table of UFO sightings data and  filter it by five parameters. The drawback of this design is that these filters work only separately so you can't filter the data by two or more parameters at the same time. 

For further development I would recommend to make these filters work together and add a responsive map of the sightings.
